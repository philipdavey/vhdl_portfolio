# VHDL Implementation of AES-128: Encryption and Decryption

### What is AES?

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a cryptographic algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt information.

- Plaintext: Original form of data before encryption.
- Ciphertext: Once the Plaintext has been encrypted, an unintelligible form is created called the Ciphertext.
